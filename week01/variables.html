            <p class="green">❔Why is the result variable value assigned '12' versus 3?</p>
            <p>JavaScript performs implicit type coercion when you use the + operator with different types of values.
                In this case, you have a numeric value 1 and a string value '2'. When you try to concatenate a string
                with a number using the + operator, JavaScript converts the number to a string and performs
                <strong>string concatenation</strong> and not mathmatical addition.
            </p>

            <summary>Answer: #2</summary>
            <p class="green">❔What are some other built in functions or methods that can change a string (sequence of
                characters) to a number?</p>
            <p>The <strong>parseInt()</strong> function parses a string and returns an integer.</p>
            <p>The <strong>parseFloat()</strong> function parses a string and returns a floating-point number.</p>
            <p><strong>Unary plus operator</strong> (+), e.g., <code>result = one; result += +two; </code>. Using the
                unary plus operator converts a string to a number.</p>
            <p><strong>Number()</strong> constructur can be used to create a new Number object, or when called as a
                function, it converts a string to a number data type.</p>

            <summary>Answer: #3</summary>
            <p class="green">❔Was the result what you expected?</p>
            <p>In this case, the implicit type coercion with the '*' multiplication operator, the conversion is from a
                string to a number. So the variable two with the value of '2' is converted to a number.</p>

            <summary>Answer: #4</summary>
            <p class="green">❔What is the meaning and definition of the acronym NaN?</p>
            <p>"Not a Number". It is a special value that represents the result of an invalid or undefined mathematical
                operation. If any operand in an arithmetic expression is NaN, the result of the entire expression will
                be NaN. NaN is not equal to any value, including NaN.</p>

            <summary>Answer: #5</summary>
            <p class="green">❔Did we get the value we expected? Why didn't it work?</p>
            <p>In order to view #5 and #6, you will need to fix the error. "Assignment to a constant variable" means
                that a variable declared as a constant was attempted to be used as the result of an expression
                (reassigned a value). You cannot do this with const which makes them very useful. Solution is to change
                from const to let on the variables declaration: <code>let two = '2';</code> on line#3 of the JavaScript.
            </p>

            <summary>Answer: #6</summary>
            <p class="green">❔Change the array declaration by adding in the number 4 and place it in its correct
                acscending order position.</p>
            <p>const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];</p>
